# Solar Energy Forecasting and Solar Panel Angle Optimization 
This repository contains a comprehensive solution to two distinct problems related to solar energy utilization:

## **Solar Energy Production Forecasting Model:**
Problem Statement
Accurate prediction of solar energy output is crucial for grid management and planning. The integration of solar energy into the power grid is a key component of the transition towards renewable energy. However, solar energy production is highly dependent on various environmental factors and temporal variables.

Objective
Develop a machine learning model capable of forecasting solar energy production based on publicly available environmental data. The model should provide reliable forecasts for both short-term and long-term periods.

Solution
We have developed two machine learning models to address short-term and long-term forecasting needs:

Short-term Solar Energy Forecasting Model: This model predicts solar power output for the next 24 hours. It utilizes historical weather data, solar irradiance, and other relevant features to make accurate predictions.

Long-term Solar Energy Forecasting Model: Extending the forecasting horizon to the next 7 days, this model considers seasonal patterns, historical trends, and other long-term factors to provide reliable forecasts of solar energy production.

Repository Structure
/data: Contains sample datasets used for model training and validation.
/short_term_model: Contains the implementation of the short-term forecasting model.
/long_term_model: Contains the implementation of the long-term forecasting model.
README.md: Main readme file detailing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Usage
Once the models are trained, they can be used to make predictions on new data. Detailed instructions on how to use the models and interpret the results are available in the documentation.

## **Optimal Solar Panel Angle Optimization Model**
Problem Statement
The efficiency of solar panels is highly dependent on their orientation with respect to the sun. Finding the optimal angles for solar panel placement can significantly enhance energy capture and utilization.

Objective
Develop an algorithm that computes the optimal solar panel angles based on seasonal sun positions to maximize energy capture throughout the year.

Solution
We have implemented an algorithm that suggests the best solar panel angles for each day of the year. By considering seasonal variations in sun position, weather patterns, and other environmental factors, the algorithm provides precise recommendations for solar panel orientation.

Repository Structure
/panel_angle_algorithm: Contains the implementation of the solar panel angle optimization algorithm.
README.md: Main readme file detailing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Usage
Users can interact with the algorithm to compute optimal solar panel angles for any given location and date. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm and interpret the results are available in the documentation.
